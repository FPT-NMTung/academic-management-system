## Introduction
The AMS system is an Internet-based website that will support SRO in optimally managing classes, students, lecturers, and curriculum. SRO can create classes based on the created list of students, and manage that class information including courses, instructors, class time, classrooms, attendance status, and learning results of the students. In addition, they can export the management information in excel form, and import it directly into the Indian system. Instructors can view student information, and class information and directly check attendance students through the website. Students also easily track class information, and their learning progress and send GPAs to evaluate the instructors.
